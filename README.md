Spin up a Node.js-driven Server (on port 3000)

Handle two Routes: "/" and "/users"
1. Return some greeting text on "/"
2. Return a list of dummy users (e.g. ```<ul><li>User 1</li><ul>``` )
3. Add a form with a "username" ```<input>``` to the "/" page and submit a POST request to the "/create-user" upon a button click
4. Add the "/create-user" route and parse the incoming data (i.e. the username) and simply log it to the console
